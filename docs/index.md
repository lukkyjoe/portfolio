Hi, I am Joseph Luk. I'm a husband, father, and senior software engineer at [StationA](https://www.stationa.com). Formerly @[swiftly](https://goswift.ly) and [paypal](www.paypal.com).

I am interested in the intersection of sustainability, design, and politics. My most recent side hobby has been to help cities organize and write [waste disposal guidelines](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/helping-cities-organize-and-write-waste-recycling-compost-disposal-guidelines-af9b5da5bd). Check out the project at www.mywaste.info.
