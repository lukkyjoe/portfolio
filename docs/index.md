Hi, I am Joseph Luk. I'm a husband, father, and software engineer at [Swiftly](https://www.goswift.ly).

I am interested in the intersection of sustainability, design, and politics. My most recent side hobby has been to help cities organize and write [waste disposal guidelines](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/helping-cities-organize-and-write-waste-recycling-compost-disposal-guidelines-af9b5da5bd). Check out the project at www.mywaste.info.

Find me on [Github](https://www.github.com/lukkyjoe), or email me at <joseph.sc.luk@gmail.com>.
